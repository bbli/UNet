* Figure out whether I should be using transpose or UpSample
    * Just go with tranpose because according to this guy on stackexchane "In segmentation, we first downsample the image to get the features and then upsample the image to generate the segments."
* Figure out how to crop image and perserve the computational graph
* complete network

* Decide on loss function
* Define accuracy function
